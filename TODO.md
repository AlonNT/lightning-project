# TODO

- VVVVVV In addition to revenue graph - number of transactions up until now. 
  7 graphs (For each agent and for each score).
  We hope that routeness will be the best.
  Also low fee policies.
- VVVVVV Fees tradeoff:
  For each agent and for each score, use different fees and plot revenue and #tx.
- VVVVVV Comparing L++ v.s. greedy - reminder to the last point!!
- VVVVVV Final graph - the best of each agent, and the random one.
