# TODO

- In addition to revenue graph - number of transactions up until now. 
  We hope that routeness will be the best.
  Also low fee policies.
- Fees tradeoff:
  For each agent and for each score, use different fees and plot revenue and #tx.
  Also plot the histogram of the base-fee (with density function).
- Make the L++ connect to the nodes themselves and not to the neighbors, and COMPARE.
- In L++ routeness DO NOT connect to the neighbors, connect to the nodes themselves.
- According to the result of the previous comparison, 
  change the greedy/L++ so they will be the same. 
- Comparing L++ v.s. greedy.
  Use d=16 new channels per agent. 
- In L++ compare with & without distance.
- Compare default policy and custom policy on greedy with 2 types of scores.
- Final graph - the best of each agent, and the random one.
